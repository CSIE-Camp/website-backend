# Definitely Not The API Document You're Looking For

This document describes how to send data to the backend and what responses to expect under different circumstances.

Feel free to ask us if you have any uncertainties regarding the usage of the APIs.

<br/><br/>
## **Before we start** ##
We should ensure that our users' data and our server is as safe as possible.

- If you are using npm, run ``npm -audit`` and check for vulnerabilities.
- Use the latest available packages if possible.
- Trust no body, not even your parents. **All** users's input should be validated and sanitized regardless of the user's role.
- We will not be the safest thing on the internet but let's at least be safer than é˜¿èŽ«'s order form. ðŸ¤§

<br/>

### API Docs
Using `https://localhost:${process.env.PORT}/api/docs/` to see the api docments. API referenced from [Unicourse API Spec](https://github.com/UniCourse-TW/API-Spec/blob/main/spec.yaml).
